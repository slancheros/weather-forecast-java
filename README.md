## Weather Central Project

This component will aggregate the  weekly weather forecast for some of the open Weather APIs. 
The user is able to select the service, location and units through the UI.

## Implementation
The project uses microservices to retrieve information from each weather service. Microservices are coded in Java with Spring stack and make part of an Eureka network, which allows them to be connected and discovered dinamically.
